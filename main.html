	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.It makes us a efficient programmer.</p>
	<p2><b>Space Complexity</b> is the working space or storage that is required by any algorithm.The time complexity of this approach is typically better than O(n) because the search is guided by the spatial structure, which eliminates the need to compare distances with all drivers. </p2>
